# **Machine Learning Specialization (Coursera | Stanford)**

Welcome to my repository for the Machine Learning Specialization\! This repo serves as a comprehensive portfolio of my work, notes, and implementations from the three courses in this program taught by Andrew Ng.

The primary goal here isn't just to store course files, but to demonstrate a deep and practical understanding of the concepts by organizing the labs, adding personal revision notebooks, and implementing core models from scratch.

## **Specialization Overview**

- Build ML models with NumPy & scikit-learn, build & train supervised models for prediction & binary classification tasks (linear, logistic regression)
- Build & train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification, & build & use decision trees & tree ensemble methods
- Apply best practices for ML development & use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning including clustering & anomaly detection
- Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach & a content-based deep learning method & build a deep reinforcement learning model

This specialization is divided into three main courses, each building upon the last:

1. **Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**  
   * Linear Regression, Gradient Descent, Logistic Regression, Regularization.  
   * Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy & scikit-learn
   * Build & train supervised machine learning models for prediction & binary classification tasks, including linear regression & logistic regression
2. **Course 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms**  
   * Neural Networks, TensorFlow, Model Evaluation (Bias/Variance), Advice for ML.  
   * Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification
   * Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world
   * Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees
3. **Course 3: Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning**  
   * K-Means Clustering, Anomaly Detection, Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, Reinforcement Learning.
   * Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning: including clustering and anomaly detection
   * Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method
   * Build a deep reinforcement learning model

## **Repository Structure**

This repository is organized into folders corresponding to each course, along with custom projects and revision materials.

* /C1 \- Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification/: Contains all labs, assignments, and notes for Course 1, organized by week.  
* /C2 \- Advanced Learning Algorithms/: Contains all labs, assignments, and notes for Course 2, organized by week.  
* /C3 \- Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning/: Contains all labs, assignments, and notes for Course 3, organized by week.  
* /Revision/: Consolidated notebooks used for studying and synthesizing concepts across courses.  

## **Key Concepts & Highlights**

Here are some of the key topics from the specialization, along with links to the relevant work in this repo.

### **1\. Core Models from Scratch**

* **File:** \[From Scratch/Model.py\](./From%20Scratch/Model.py)  
* **Description:** To prove my understanding beyond just using libraries, I implemented linear and logistic regression models from scratch using only NumPy. This includes the core functions for:  
  * compute\_cost (Cost Function)  
  * compute\_gradient (Gradient Calculation)  
  * gradient\_descent (Gradient Descent Algorithm)

### **2\. Model Evaluation & Selection**

* **File:** \[C2.../Week 3/C2W3\_Lab\_01\_Model\_Evaluation\_and\_Selection.ipynb\](./C2%20-%20Advanced%20Learning%20Algorithms/Week%203/C2W3\_Lab\_01\_Model\_Evaluation\_and\_Selection.ipynb)  
* **Description:** This lab covers the critical process of evaluating a model. I worked with splitting data into training, cross-validation (dev), and test sets to make informed decisions about model architecture and prevent overfitting.

### **3\. Diagnosing Bias and Variance**

* **File:** \[C2.../Week 3/C2W3\_Lab\_02\_Diagnosing\_Bias\_and\_Variance.ipynb\](./C2%20-%20Advanced%20Learning%20Algorithms/Week%203/C2W3\_Lab\_02\_Diagnosing\_Bias\_and\_Variance.ipynb)  
* **Description:** A key skill in machine learning is knowing *how* to improve a model. This notebook focuses on diagnosing high bias (underfitting) vs. high variance (overfitting) by analyzing learning curves and implementing solutions like regularization.

### **4\. Tree Ensembles (Random Forest & XGBoost)**

* **File:** \[C2.../Week 4/C2\_W4\_Lab\_02\_Tree\_Ensemble.ipynb\](./C2%20-%20Advanced%20Learning%20Algorithms/Week%204/C2\_W4\_Lab\_02\_Tree\_Ensemble.ipynb)  
* **Description:** Explored advanced supervised models, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and the powerful XGBoost algorithm. This lab demonstrates practical application and the significant performance boost from ensemble methods.

### **5\. Consolidated Revision & Synthesis**

* **File:** \[Revision/Revision 1.ipynb\](./Revision/Revision%201.ipynb)  
* **Description:** This revision notebook synthesizes my understanding of core supervised models. It covers:  
  * The mathematical foundation of regularized linear and logistic regression.  
  * Side-by-side implementation with Scikit-Learn.  
* **File:** \[Revision/Revision 2.ipynb\](./Revision/Revision%202.ipynb)  
* **Description:** This notebook synthesizes key concepts from Course 2, including:  
  * Data preprocessing for neural networks (e.g., One-Hot Encoding).  
  * Implementing NNs using **TensorFlow** and Keras.

## **Dependencies**

* The lab notebooks (.ipynb) run in a Jupyter environment with standard data science libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, tensorflow).  
* The deeplearning.mplstyle and utils.py files are helper files provided by the course and are expected to be in the root directory.
